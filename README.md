# ObjectAvoidingRobot
Arduino code for an object avoiding robot. The robot has four motors that are driven tank style (differential steering)  and uses 3 ultrasonic range sensors to detect objects. No form of closed loop control is used to drive the motors which means that the robot will most likely not move in a perfect line.
